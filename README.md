# JohnsonTrotter
Hello and welcome to the horror that is the Johnson Trotter algorithm.
Unlike some, there does not exist a concise and enjoyable version of this algorithm which generates all permutations of n-elements. 
I had to create this for a class and now I share it with all of you. I hope you enjoy it more than I did writing it.
